HiddenMarkovModelsInPython
==========================

Functional code in Python for creating Hidden Markov Models. Learning is possible. Using extended logarithmic and exponential functions to avoid overflow. Based on Tobias P. Mann's *Numerically Stable Hidden Markov Model Implementation* and Mark Stamp's *A Revealing Introduction to Hidden Markov Models*. Bug feedback is appreciated.
