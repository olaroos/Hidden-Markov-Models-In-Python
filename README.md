Hidden Markov Models in Python
==========================

Functional code in Python for creating Hidden Markov Models. Functions can be used for learning. Using extended logarithmic and exponential functions to avoid overflow. Based on Tobias P. Mann's *Numerically Stable Hidden Markov Model Implementation* and Mark Stamp's *A Revealing Introduction to Hidden Markov Models*. Bug feedback is appreciated.
