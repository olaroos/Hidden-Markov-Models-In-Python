HiddenMarkovModelsInPython
==========================

Functional code in Python for creating Hidden Markov Models. Supervised learning is possible. All functions uses extended logarithmic and exponential functions to avoid overflow when working with longer chains. Based on Tobias P. Mann's *Numerically Stable Hidden Markov Model Implementation* and Mark Stamp's *A Revealing Introduction to Hidden Markov Models*. Bug feedback is appreciated.
